# TelsJinn Mobile App

This folder contains a small React Native (Expo) application that demonstrates how to send the Tesla "after blow" command using the Tesla API.

## Running

1. Install Node.js and `expo-cli`.
2. Run `npm install` inside this folder.
3. Use `npm run android` or `npm run ios` to launch the application.

You will need a Tesla API access token. The app can fetch your vehicles from the Tesla API and automatically fill in the first vehicle ID.

If you prefer a native Android version, see the `../android` folder.
